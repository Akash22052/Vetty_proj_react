# Project Management Dashboard

This is a project management dashboard where you can create, update, and delete lists and cards. It's inspired by Jira's board system, where each list contains multiple cards, and you can manage them easily.

## Features
- Add, update, and delete lists.
- Add, update, and delete cards inside the lists.
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`, so data is preserved even after refreshing or reopening the page.
- Simple user interface with functionality to manage tasks.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 14.x
- npm (Node Package Manager)
